## How do I use this?
You start the `JAR` file, enter the Wii U's IP address and the select the file you want to send. You have to be in the [`Homebrew Channel`](http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Homebrew_Channel) or [`Homebrew Launcher`](https://gbatemp.net/threads/homebrew-launcher-for-wiiu.416905/) respectively.

## Sending is not working for me?
Your computer and Wii U have to be in the same local network. Also make sure your anti virus and firewall are disabled in case it still does not work.
